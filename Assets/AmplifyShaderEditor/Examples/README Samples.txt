How to Install Samples

  Samples are provided by pipeline. To import the samples please use the "Start Screen" to do so instead of 
  unpacking manually, this will ensure that they are imported correctly:

  Go to Windows > Amplify Shader Editor > Start Screen and under "Shader Samples" select the ones you wish to 
  import. Do be aware that importing any SRP samples requires to first install the respective pipeline using 
  the package manager.

  Please notice that in some cases the sample may have been created in a different version from the SRP that 
  you are using which can produce "pink" shaders. If that happens it's usually the case that you only need to 
  open the shader in ASE and save it to update it.

Additional Samples for FREE

  A large number of additional shader samples can be found in Amplify Shader Pack (ASP), available on the Asset Store:
  This sample pack is made available free of charge, if you already own Amplify Shader Editor (ASE).

    3. Add ASP to your cart
    4. Go to checkout and ASP should be FREE (make sure that the value is 0, do not proceed otherwise)
    5. Have fun!
